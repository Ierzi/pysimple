# PySimple
A module that gives modifications, new functions and better syntax to python. This is PySimple.

# What is PySimple?

PySimple is a Python module that provides various modifications, new functions, and improved syntax for Python programming. It offers the following functionalities:

    Pi Collections:
        return_pi(): Returns the value of pi from the math module.
        return_simpler_pi(): Returns a simplified value of pi (3.1415926535).
        return_really_simple_pi(): Returns a further simplified value of pi (3.14159).
        return_simplest_pi(): Returns the simplest value of pi (3.14).
        return_not_a_pi(): Returns a different numerical value (3).

    Random Functions:
        modify_str(word, uppercase=False, lowercase=False): Modifies a string by converting it to uppercase or lowercase based on the provided arguments.
        isin(what, in_): Simplified syntax for checking if an element is present in a list.
        coin_flip(): Simulates a coin flip and returns a boolean value (True or False).
        cf(): An abbreviated version of coin_flip().

    Binary:
        binary(binary_string): Translates binary strings into text.
        binary_database(index=None): Returns a random binary string from a predefined database. If an index is provided, it returns the binary string at that specific index.

    Decorators:
        return_none(func): A decorator that saves lines of code by automatically returning None at the end of a function.
        block(func): A decorator that effectively blocks the execution of a function.

    Bigger Functions:
        typefinder(var=None): Attempts to determine the type of the provided variable.
        FileManagement: A class for managing file operations, including opening and closing files.
        time_function(func): A decorator that measures and prints the time in seconds required to run a function.
        Timer: A class for measuring the execution time of a specific code block.
        sort_values(*values): Takes multiple string or list values and prints them in alphabetical order.
        create_list(*values, sorting=False, count_print=False, count_var=False, find=None): Takes multiple string or list values and returns a list containing those values. 
        Additional options include sorting the list, printing the items, counting the number of items, and searching for a specific value.

Please note that some functionalities may be incomplete or broken, as indicated in the code comments. Note also that this is all the modifications I gave to python in Pysimple Beta 1.1. If you are not with the beta 1.1 version, some commands would be incomplete or you will have more commands than expected.

# Modules you need to install.
You need to install math, random, time and the json modules.
